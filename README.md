This program uses a file stream for an output Text Document file that displays the menu items a customer could order based on constraints reported by the customer.  First, the program conducts error handling for opening the file, and if the file opens successfully, the program makes objects for three classes and initializes them with specific food items.  The classes are for breakfast, lunch, and dinner items, respectively.  Then, the program declares two strings that filter out menu items that the customer cannot order.  Next, the program generates a random time using a random number generator.  If the time is outside of the restaurantâ€™s hours of operation, the program displays a message indicating that the customer cannot be served, and the program exits.  Otherwise, the program displays a welcome message and figures out whether the customer has dietary restrictions or does not enjoy certain food items in the first place.  If that is the case, the menu will not allow said food items to be written into the Text Document file at the end of the program.  Also, the randomly generated time allows the menu to be filtered based on what foods cannot be served outside of certain time frames.  Finally, the program writes the menu items that were not filtered out to the Text Document file, and the program closes that file stream.  Sample output from running the program is shown in the Text Document file.
